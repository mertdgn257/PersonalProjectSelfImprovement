Week 1: Awareness and Understanding Myself
I started by documenting my daily habits and thoughts with a journal. Every morning and evening, I wrote down how I felt, wins throughout the day, and parts where I struggled. With this, I concluded that I procrastinate often and excessively use social media, specifically after school when I feel tired. This inevitably lead me to postpone school work and notice a reappearing pattern of self-doubt whenever I faced challenges with my personal project and school.

I set three goals to focus on:
1. Reducing overall anxiety and stress
2. Improving productivity and focus
3. Building confidence in academic situations

Through tracking sleep, study, and exercise habits, I reached a general conclusion. For instance, I found that my productivity and focus was at their highest in the evening, but I frequently wasted it by doomscrolling on instagram. I also thought about previous achievements — like finishing the last school year with a high average — and noticed that organized routines are what helped me succeed initially. This small reflection was a source of motivation and helped me regain momentum.

Week 2: Starting Small Habits
I chose to integrate manageable changes instead of trying to reinvent my life overnight. I focused on one habit per area:

* Meditation for 5 minutes every morning after brushing my teeth
* Reading 20 pages daily to improve focus and knowledge (Self-improvement books)
* Daily reflection in my journal to track emotions and progress

At first, meditation seemed challenging. My mind was constantly thinking about other things — consequently, I couldn’t focus. But by the fifth day, I observed a calmer mindset during lessons, and my journaling helped me see my stress triggers. Additionally, I started using habit stacking. I read right after breakfast and journaled before bed. During this week, I saw the value of consistency over intensity. Small changes, too, began to feel joyful. I could already see a couple improvements in focus and my attention span had improved.

Week 3: Reflection, Adjustment, and Support
By the third week, I determined things that worked out and things that didn’t. Meditation became normal, so I increased it to 10 minutes. Reading was consistent, but I was unknowingly rushing through it. I decided to slow down. Journaling uncovered that my biggest stress triggers were procrastination and anxiety. In addition, I sought feedback from close friends and family members. Their insights helped me solidify progress and motivated me.

I began visualizing mid-term goals, like finishing homework without getting distracted and feeling confident during speaking exams. Moreover, I started reflecting on my mood shift; I was content with myself after I performed a habit and found myself curiously planning what to do next. I could almost see my confidence stacking up like Lego bricks as I completed tasks I previously avoided.

Week 4: Integration and Deep Reflection
During the final week, I channeled my focus on fully implementing these habits into my daily routine. Meditation, journaling, and reading has since become a part of my day to day schedule, and I felt more in control of my life. I also added an exercise routine I used to previously follow to complement mental clarity.

Reflecting on the entire month, the changes were remarkable:
* Anxiety and stress were more manageable, especially in high-pressure situations
* My focus improved and I could complete tasks without wasting much time
* My confidence grew as I noticed progress in areas I previously neglected 

Daily journaling allowed me to track small wins alongside my personal growth. For example, I managed a stressful assignment instead of getting overwhelmed by it. This reflection helped me realize how tiny and consistent actions truly build up into impactful, long-term improvement.

Towards the end of the four weeks, I gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of self-improvement. I learned that growth meant showing up when it mattered, not pursuing perfection. The process reinforced my discipline, improved my daily routine, and gave a practical guide I can use to continue improving myself beyond these four weeks.
